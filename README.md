# RenewPass
An Android app for renewing your UPass

RenewPass does the work of renewing your UPass for you. Enter your school credentials, and RenewPass will log in to your UPassBC account and request the latest available UPass, all with a single tap.

Your school credentials are stored locally on your phone, and your password is encrypted before being saved, so only RenewPass can see it.

### Currently supported schools:
- Simon Fraser University
- University of British Columbia

More schools are coming soon! If you want to speed up the process, help us test or submit a pull request (Look at app/src/main/java/ca/alexland/renewpass/schools/SimonFraserUniversity.java for an example).
