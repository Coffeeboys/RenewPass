# Privacy Policy

RenewPass strictly saves credential information locally on the device. Passwords are encrypted before being saved on compatible devices (API 18 and up). The key used to encrypt the password is stored in the Android Keystore.

## Who can access your data?

Only someone with access to your device can access your data. Extracting the saved credentials requires root access to the phone, along with physical access to the device.

## Questions/Concerns

The code is all here, so take a look for yourself if you don't trust us (we understand). Any questions or concerns can be voiced to vancoffeeboys (at) gmail.com.
